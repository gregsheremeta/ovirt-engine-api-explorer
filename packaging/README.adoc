= oVirt API Explorer Packaging

== Introduction

This directory contains the files required to package the explorer for
packaging systems like RPM.

== RPM

To build the RPM place the `.tar.gz` file containing the distribution of
the application in this directory and then run run the `build.sh`
script, specifying the version with the `tar_version` environment
variable. For example, if the name of the tar file is
`ovirt-engine-api-explorer-0.0.3.tar.gz` then use the following command:

  $ tar_version=0.0.3 build.sh

If the name of the `.tar.gz` file isn't the expected one, you can also
use the `tar_file` environment variable:

  tar_version=0.0.3 tar_file="mytar.tar.gz" build.sh

The resulting `.rpm` file will be created in the `noarch` subdirectory.

When installed the RPM will put the files in the
`/usr/share/ovirt-engine-api-explorer` directory.
